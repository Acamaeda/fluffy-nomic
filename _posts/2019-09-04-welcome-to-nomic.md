Dear Maeda,

How are you today?

I would like to formally invite you to a game of Nomic. The
[rules]({{"/rules/" | relative_url}}) may be quite familiar to you, since they
are heavily based on the ones you wrote for our game in Lopam, but I suggest
you give them a look over, since there are some differences in how I wrote a
few of them.

Since Git is something we both know how to use, I was thinking the Jekyll-based
Github Pages platform would be a great place to host our game. It's one of the
simplest ways to host a website, and it takes very little energy to set up.

The idea I'm going for is that we might use the rules of Nomic as a framework
for writing other more rigid games. My hope is that we can come up with fun
cooperative games to play together, but of course this isn't part of the rules.
You could just as easily make this nomic a cutthroat game of deception.

By the way, the Github repository is
[EmmiaSilk/fluffy-nomic](github.com/fluffy-nomic). Let me know if you would
like to join, and I'll add you as a contributor to the repository. If you have
any questions, I'm usually around to answer them. We can also make changes to
the rules before we start if you would like something important added.

I hope you're interested!

~ Emmia Silk
