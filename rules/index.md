## 1. Basic Rule
Follow the rules. Everything that renders in the '/rules/' directory on the
website is part of the rules unless stated otherwise.

## 2. Rule Changes
A rule change is any of the following:
  - Adding a rule
  - Changing a rule
  - Removing a rule

## 3. Voting
All rule-changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted in a Decision.
They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of votes.

## 4. Eligible Voters
Every player is an eligible voter.

## 5. Retroactive Effects
Rules cannot have retroactive effects.
They don’t affect anything before they were made.

## 6. Rule Names
Each enacted rule shall be given a name and number for reference.
These names and numbers must be unique.

## 7 Rule Changes
A rule change is adopted when a majority of voters vote for it, and fails if
at least half of eligible voters vote against it.
### 7.a Debates
Other players may suggest amendments or argue against the proposal before the
vote.
A reasonable time must be allowed for this debate.
The proponent decides the final form in which the proposal is to be voted on
and also decides the time to end debate and vote.
### 7.b Execution time
An adopted rule-change takes full effect at the end of the turn on which it is
adopted.

## 8. Freedom of Choice
If the game stops being fun or for any other reason, you are allowed to leave
the game.

## 9. Rule of Freedom
Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a rule is permitted and unregulated,
with the sole exception of changing the rules, which is permitted only when a
rule or set of rules explicitly permits it.

## 10. Turns
It is always one player's turn.
### 10.a Actions
During their turn, the player may do any actions that the rules say they can do
on their turn until they run out of options or another rule ends their turn or
prevents them from taking more actions.
### 10.b Turn Order
After a player finishes their turn, it becomes the next player’s turn.
Turn order will be in the order that players joined the game. This order can be
found at the [players]({{ "players.html" | relative_url }}) page for reference.
### 10.c Rule Change Action
A player may make a single rule change on their turn.

## 11. Decisions
Each player always has exactly one vote per decision.

## 12. Rule Seniority
If rules conflict, lower-numbered rules override higher-numbered ones, unless
one rule specifically says it overrides another.

## 14. Rule of Adjudication
If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or
application of a rule, then players will vote to make a decision, which may
include amendment to clarify the rule in question. (If there is a disagreement
about the rules, we vote on what to do.)

## 15. Solving Impossible Problems
If a rule is created that cannot be followed due to technical limitations, it
must be modified or removed. (i.e. if someone tries to make something that we
can’t find a way to make work then we can’t do it)

## 16. Have fun!
